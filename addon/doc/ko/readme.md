This add-on is used to add text to the clipboard, which can be useful when
you want to join sections of text together ready for pasting.  The clipboard
content can also be cleared.

Input gestures dialog, Configuration category.

## Changes for 5.0 ##

  appearance of the dialogs shown in NVDA.
*	Requires NVDA 2016.4 or later.


## Changes for 4.0 ##

*	Add-on settings are managed from NVDA configuration, so that standard
  profiles can be used to save different separators, and it's not needed to
  copy the settings for importing at reinstallation.
*	Now it's possible to choose if the added text will be appended or
  prepended, using the Add text before clip data check box from the Clip

  Contents Designer settings dialog.

## Changes for 3.0 ##

*	Braille representation of MathML objects can be added to the clipboard if
  MathPlayer is installed.
*	If no separator is set, just a single line will be placed between the
  added text segments.
*	A shortcut can be assigned to open the Clip Contents Designer settings
  dialog.

*	Added a check box in the settings dialog, for choosing if the separator
  should be copied to be imported when reinstalling the add-on.
