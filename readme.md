This add-on is used to append text to the clipboard, which can be useful when you want to join sections of text together ready for pasting.
The clipboard content can also be cleared.

## Keyboard commands ##
*   NVDA+windows+c: Append selected text, Unicode braille characters which represent MathML objects, or the string which has been marked with the review cursor, to the clipboard.
*   NVDA+windows+x: Clear clipboard contents.
*   NVDA+windows+f9: Mark the current position of the review cursor as the start of the text to be added to the clipboard.
    If you use nvda+F9, the text will not be appended.

Note: The above commands can be changed from NVDA menu, Preferences submenu, Input gestures dialog, Text review category.

## Preferences Menu ##
*   Clip Contents Designer settings: Allows to set a separator which can be used to find the text segments once the entire appended text is pasted.

## Changes for 2.0 ##
*   Hindi characters can be used as the separator between appended contents.

## Changes for 1.0 ##
