This add-on is used to add text to the clipboard, which can be useful when you want to join sections of text together ready for pasting.
The clipboard content can also be cleared an shown in browse mode.

## Keyboard commands ##
*	NVDA+windows+c: Add selected text, Unicode braille characters which represent MathML objects, or the string which has been marked with the review cursor, to the clipboard.
*	NVDA+windows+x: Clear clipboard contents.
*	 Not assigned: Copies to (or cuts from) the clipboard, with the possibility of being asked for a previous confirmation.
*	 Not assigned: Shows the clipboard text as HTML in browse mode, or announces if clipboard is empty or has contents which can't be presented in a browseable message, for instance if files or folders are been copied from Windows Explorer.
*	 Not assigned: Shows the textual clipboard contents as plain text in browse mode, or announces if clipboard is empty or has contents which can't be presented in a browseable message, for instance if files or folders are been copied from Windows Explorer.


## Clip Contents Designer settings ##

This panel is available from NVDA's menu, Preferences submenu, Settings dialog.

It contains the following controls:

* Type the string to be used as a separator between contents added to the clipboard: Allows to set a separator which can be used to find the text segments once the entire added text is pasted.
* Add text before clip data: It's also possible to choose if the added text will be appended or prepended.
* Select the actions which require previous confirmation: You can choose, for each action available, if it should be performed inmediately or after confirmation. Available actions are: add text, clear clipboard, emulate copy and emulate cut.
* Request confirmation before performing the selected actions when: You can select if confirmations will be requested always, just if text is contained in the clipboard, or if clipboard is not empty (for example if you've copied a file, not text).
* Format to show the clipboard text as HTML in browse mode: If you're learning HTML markup language, you may choose Preformatted text in HTML or HTML as shown in a web browser, to have an idea of how your HTML code will be rendered by NVDA in a browser. The difference between preformatted and conventional HTML is that the first option will preserve consecutive spaces and line breaks, and the second one will compact them.  For example, write some HTML tags like h1, h2, li, pre, etc., select and copy the text to clipboard, and use clipContentsDesigner add-on to show the text in a browseable message.
* Maximum number of characters when showing clipboard text in browse mode: Please, be aware that increasing this limit may produce issues if the clipboard contains large strings of text. The default limit is 100000 characters.

Notes:

*	Confirmations won't be requested when a message box of NVDA is still opened. In those cases, actions will be inmediately performed.
* Emulate copy and emulate cut commands mean that, when these features are enabled, the add-on will take control of control+c and control+x. This will allow to select if a confirmation should be requested before performing the actions corresponding to these keystrokes.
