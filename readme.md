This add-on is used to add text to the clipboard, which can be useful when you want to join sections of text together ready for pasting.
The clipboard content can also be cleared an shown in browse mode.

## Keyboard commands ##
*	NVDA+windows+c: Add selected text, Unicode braille characters which represent MathML objects, or the string which has been marked with the review cursor, to the clipboard.
*	NVDA+windows+x: Clear clipboard contents.
*	 Not assigned: Copies to (or cuts from) the clipboard, with the possibility of being asked for a previous confirmation.
*	 Not assigned: Shows the clipboard text in browse mode, or announces if clipboard is empty or has contents which can't be presented in a browseable message, for instance if files or folders are been copied from Windows Explorer.

Note: The above commands can be changed from NVDA menu, Preferences submenu, Input gestures dialog, Text review category.

## Preferences Menu ##
*	Clip Contents Designer settings: Allows to set a separator which can be used to find the text segments once the entire added text is pasted.
It's also possible to choose if the added text will be appended or prepended, if available actions (add, clear clipboard, emulate copy and emulate cut) should be performed inmediately or after confirmation, and if confirmations will be requested always, just if text is contained in the clipboard, or if clipboard is not empty.
Furthermore, it's possible to change the format and maximum number of characters of the clipboard text which will be shown in browse mode. Please, be aware that increasing this limit may produce issues if the clipboard contains large strings of text. The default limit is 100000 characters.

Notes:

*	The above command can be changed from NVDA menu, Preferences submenu, Input gestures dialog, Configuration category.
*	Confirmations won't be requested when a message box of NVDA is still opened. In those cases, actions will be inmediately performed.
